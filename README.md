# TrafficForecasting
Apprehending the importance of road traffic forecasting in this contemporary world can be explained by first stating the volume of vehicles flowing on the roads in the modern times. It is stated that there are about 1.446 billion vehicles in todayâ€™s time. Delineating the scenario of growth of vehicles count, it is observed that there has been an exponential surge from 342 million in 1976 to more than 50% (670 million) in 1996 and now the vehicles count has surpassed 1.4 billion count. Industrial analysts thus prognosticate that if vehicles count sees this heightening trend of doubling every 20 years, then the situation is alarming as it would have grave consequences on the global economy and environment, so appropriate regulatory measures need to be imposed. Hence, extensive efforts need to be put for road traffic management and forecasting.
